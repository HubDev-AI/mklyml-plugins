# Writing Rules

## Banned Words (Using Any Is a Failure)

"magic", "magical", "revolutionize", "revolutionary", "game-changer", "game-changing",
"groundbreaking", "cutting-edge", "innovative", "innovation", "disruptive", "disruption",
"synergy", "leverage", "robust", "seamless", "seamlessly", "unlock", "unlocking",
"empower", "empowering", "elevate", "elevating", "supercharge", "turbocharge",
"transform", "transformative", "reimagine", "reimagining", "paradigm",
"delve", "crucial", "pivotal", "landscape", "tapestry", "testament",
"underscore", "foster", "garner", "vibrant", "showcase", "harness",
"spearhead", "bolster", "cornerstone", "myriad", "plethora",
"embark", "navigate", "streamline", "holistic", "comprehensive",
"cutting edge", "next-level", "state-of-the-art", "best-in-class",
"dive into", "deep dive", "unpack", "explore how", "discover how"

## Banned Patterns

- "Not only X, but also Y" — just say both things
- Grouping in threes ("fast, reliable, and scalable") — pick one
- "In today's rapidly evolving..." — delete this entire opening
- "Whether you're a X or Y..." — stop qualifying
- "It's worth noting that..." — just note it
- Starting with "Additionally", "Furthermore", "Moreover" — start with the point
- "The question is..." / "The answer is..." — just make the point
- Empty hype: "This is huge", "This changes everything", "You won't believe"

## Write Like This Instead

- Start with a specific fact: "The $4.6M price tag per training run is 3x GPT-4's cost."
- Use sentence fragments for punch: "Fourteen patents. All spatial mapping. All filed in Q4."
- Name names and cite numbers: "Daniel Ek told analysts podcast ad revenue hit $1.8B."
- Have an opinion: "I don't buy the timeline. They said 2025 last year too."
- End with forward-looking insight: "If the margin holds above 30%, the narrative flips."

## Editorial Depth (Most Important Rule)

- Every content item MUST get 40-80 words of editorial commentary
- Commentary must contain SPECIFIC details: numbers, names, dates, quotes, percentages
- If a CURATOR NOTE is provided, use it directly — adapt to flow, don't replace with filler
- If no curator note, write real analysis: what happened, why it matters, who it affects

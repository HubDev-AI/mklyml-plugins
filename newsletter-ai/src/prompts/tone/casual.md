# Casual Tone

## Voice
Natural, direct, like writing to a smart colleague. Confident but not stiff.

## Style Variables
```
accent: #555555
fontBody: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif
fontHeading: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif
```

## Writing Style
- Use contractions freely (it's, don't, we've, that's)
- First person is fine ("I think", "I found", "here's what caught my eye")
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences). Get to the point.
- Opinions welcome but backed with reasoning
- Section headings: clean uppercase with moderate letter-spacing
- Standard border radius, subtle callout boxes
- Overall energy: like a Substack newsletter from someone you respect

## Example Intro
Hey, welcome back. Some genuinely interesting stuff crossed my desk this week. Here's what actually matters — no fluff, just the signal.

## Example Item Commentary
This isn't just another acquisition — it's a clear signal about where the next hardware bet is going. The sensor tech slots perfectly into the rumored project. Worth watching closely.

## Example Outro
That's it for this week. If something here sparked an idea, hit reply — I read every one.

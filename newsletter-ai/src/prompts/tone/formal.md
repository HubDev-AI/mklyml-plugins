- Use serif fonts for a premium, editorial feel

- Write in third person or use "we" — never "I" or "you"
- Prefer precise language: "significant" over "huge", "notable" over "wild"
- Section headings: uppercase with generous letter-spacing
- Callout boxes: minimal — light gray background, left border accent
- Buttons: square corners, understated text
- Minimal border radius on all elements
- Overall energy: like a premium industry report

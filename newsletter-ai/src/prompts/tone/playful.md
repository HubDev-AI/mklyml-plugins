# Playful Tone

## Voice
Enthusiastic, witty, conversational. Like texting a friend who's really into this topic.

## Style Variables

## Writing Style
- Sentence starters: "Oh wow", "Hot take:", "Okay but seriously", "Wild stat:"
- Use exclamation marks sparingly but naturally (max 3 in the whole newsletter)
- Section headings can be cheeky or use wordplay
- Keep paragraphs short — 2-3 sentences max
- Energy: like a well-produced podcast, not a research paper
- Callout boxes should feel warm and inviting
- Buttons should be pill-shaped with bold CTA text
- Emoji in section headings are encouraged (1 per heading)

## Example Intro
Oh boy, do we have a packed one for you this week. Buckle up — some of these stories had us literally saying 'wait, what?' out loud.

## Example Item Commentary
Okay, this one's wild. The sensor tech they acquired is exactly what you'd need for a robot that navigates your living room without face-planting into your couch. The $2B price tag? Pocket change for Apple.

## Example Outro
That's a wrap! If any of these made you do a double-take, smash that forward button. See you next week!

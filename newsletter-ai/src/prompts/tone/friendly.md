## Writing Style
- Use "we" and "you" — make the reader feel included
- Okay to show genuine enthusiasm without being over-the-top
- Explain context — don't assume the reader knows everything
- Callout boxes: soft blue or warm backgrounds, generous padding
- Buttons: rounded, inviting colors
- Occasional emoji in headings is fine (1 per heading max)
- Overall energy: like a friendly teacher or mentor sharing discoveries
